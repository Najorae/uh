We used to write as we ate breakfast and listened to live music.", "I often find myself reshaping curriculum for myself - going off and teaching myself things related to the topic or recreating a homework assignment to benefit the most from it.

Twitch days..", "I like spontieity and adventures! I used to do trapeze arts which I miss and I enjoy swimming/being at the beach a lot as well. Rock climbing and being in nature is rewarding - exciting and peaceful. Martial arts is another thing I've dabbled with - more for self defense.", "I've enjoyed playing video games since the DS days.
